# Anna-Pincus-Portfolio
Challenge 2 Portfolio

## Description

Anna Pincus's portfolio of coding projects

## Motivation

This portfolio was made to collect and display the completed coding projects of Anna Pincus, as well as her about me and contact information. It was completed to understand and utilize advanced CSS when creating a webpage. It provides examples of the use of media queries, selectors, flexbox, and links to view and navigate the page easily.

## Usage

This portfolio can be used to review html and css techniques. It can also be used to review Anna's completed coding projects over the course of the bootcamp.
